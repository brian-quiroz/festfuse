# About-copy sources

Retained provenance for verified `about` copy: the sources a shipped `about` was
built from, kept so a later [freshness re-review](artist-editorial-process.md#freshness-re-review)
or a challenged fact can be traced without re-researching. Rationale:
[ADR-0020](../decisions/0020-retain-about-copy-sources-after-verification.md).

How it works:

- A slug's section is written in the same commit that sets `aboutVerified: true`
  for it. The sources come straight from the verification the editor just approved.
- Each section reproduces the final `about` copy with `[\[N\]](url)` citation
  markers after the claims each source backs, then a numbered source list. Numbers
  are scoped to that section: every artist starts again at 1.
- Every marker is a link, including repeats of the same number. The rendered marker
  reads `[N]`.
- A source consulted but not used in the copy does not belong here.
- When an artist came through the [deferred-`about` variant](artist-editorial-process.md#deferred-about-variant),
  its [`artist-about-leads.md`](artist-about-leads.md) section moves here on verify.
- This is a permanent record, not a worklist. A section is never removed; a
  re-verify updates it in place. A slug appearing here means its `about` has been
  verified under ADR-0020.
- Integrity rules from the editorial process carry over: cite only a page that was
  opened and read, and a search-result summary is a pointer, not a source.

Relationship to the sibling files: [`artist-about-leads.md`](artist-about-leads.md)
holds raw facts for `about` copy not yet written;
[`artist-flagged-issues.md`](artist-flagged-issues.md) logs out-of-scope sourced
corrections; this file holds the provenance of copy that shipped.

Format, one section per slug:

```
## some-artist-slug

'Title' arrived in 2023[\[1\]](https://example.com/bio) and charted at number
